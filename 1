      <h1>HTML Elements I</h1>
      <p>The index.html document is divided into parts, after the DOCTYPE is defined, the root element is created with HTML tags, nested inside of these tags are the dependent elements, all remaining HTML elements and nodes must be nested within this.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The <a href="https://google.co.uk">HEADER</a> section would typically be used to group a logo, navigation elements and search functionality.</li>
        <li>The <a href="https://google.co.uk">MAIN</a> section would primarily be used to group the main content of the document.  This would contain the main functionality of the document and/or content that the document mainly represents.</li>
        <li>The <a href="https://google.co.uk">FOOTER</a> section typically contains copyright information and links to related documents.</li>
